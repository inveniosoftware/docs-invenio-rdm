### Shell completion

Invenio-CLI provides support for tab completion of commands and options for Bash, Zsh and Fish shells. You can install the shell completion

For Bash, add this to `~/.bashrc`:

    eval "$(_INVENIO_CLI_COMPLETE=source_bash invenio-cli)"

For Zsh, add this to `~/.zshrc`:

    eval "$(_INVENIO_CLI_COMPLETE=source_zsh invenio-cli)"

For Fish, add this to `~/.config/fish/completions/invenio-cli.fish`:

    eval (env _INVENIO_CLI_COMPLETE=source_fish invenio-cli)

The above `eval` commands will invoke your application every time a shell is started.
This may slow down shell startup time.

Alternatively, create an activation script:

For Bash:

    _INVENIO_CLI_COMPLETE=source_bash invenio-cli > invenio-cli-complete.sh

For Zsh:

    _INVENIO_CLI_COMPLETE=source_zsh invenio-cli > invenio-cli-complete.sh

In `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`, source the script instead of the `eval` command:

    . /path/to/invenio-cli-complete.sh

For Fish, add the file to the completions directory:

    _INVENIO_CLI_COMPLETE=source_fish invenio-cli > ~/.config/fish/completions/invenio-cli-complete.fish

## General commands

### **`check-requirements`**

Checks the minimal system requirements are met.

**Options**

- `-d`, `--development` Check also development requirements (defaults to not checking development requirements).

### **`destroy`**

Removes all associated resources (containers, images, volumes, Python virtual environment).

All data in services are lost.

### **`init`**

Initializes the application skeleton for the chosen flavour. Currently only `rdm` flavour is supported and it is the default value.

**Options**

- `-t`, `--template` `TEXT` Path or git URL to the Cookiecutter template.
- `-c`, `--checkout` `TEXT` Branch, tag or commit to checkout if `--template` is a git URL.

### **`install`**

Installs the project locally.

Installs Python dependencies, creates an instance directory, symlinks the `invenio.cfg`, templates, static files, assets, and finally builds front-end assets.

A python virtual environment is created if does not already exists.

**Options**

- `--pre` If specified, allows the installation of alpha releases
- `-p`, `--production` / `-d`, `--development` Production mode copies statics/assets. Development mode symlinks statics/assets (default).

### `run`

Starts the local development server.

**Options**

- `-h`, `--host` TEXT The interface to bind to.
- `-p`, `--port` INTEGER The port to bind to.
- `-d`, `--debug` / `--no-debug` Debug mode enables Flask development mode, auto-reloading and more (default: enabled).
- `-s`, `--services` / `-n`, `--no-services` Run dockerized services along with the instance or not.

## Assets commands

Statics files and assets management commands.

| Command        | Description                                        | Supported |
| :------------- | :------------------------------------------------- | :-------: |
| `install`      | Install and link a React module.                   |  v0.19.0  |
| `build`        | Build the current application static/assets files. |  v0.19.0  |
| `watch`        | Statics and assets watch commands.                 |  v0.19.0  |
| `watch-module` | Watch a JavaScript/React module.                   |  v0.19.0  |

### **`assets install`**

Install and link the JavaScript/React package specified by the path. For example:

```bash
invenio-cli assets install ~/src/react-invenio-awesome/
```

### **`assets build`**

Build the current application's static/assets files.

The default behavior of the command is to:

- Remove any existing
  1. Static files
  2. Webpack project
  3. Installed Node modules
  - Collect
    1. Static files
    2. Assets for the Webpack project
    3. InvenioRDM's instance statics and assets.
- Install all Node modules specified by the Webpack project's `package.json`.
- Build the Webpack project.

The command by default symlinks the static files and assets. This enables you to
run the `watch`. If you build with `--production`, no symlinks are created,
and the `watch` will not detect changes to your local development files.

**Options**

- `-n`, `--no-wipe` Do not remove existing assets.
- `-p`, `--production` / `-d`, `--development` Production mode copies files. Development mode creates symbolic links, this allows to have real-time changes of the files. Defaults to `--development`.

### **`assets watch`**

Watches InvenioRDM's Webpack project for changes, and automatically rebuild the project if a file is changed.

This command is useful for instance if you're editing the LESS or JavaScript files in your InvenioRDM instance.

Note, if you run `assets build` with the `--production` option, then you local development files are not symlinked, and the
`assets watch` command will not detect edits of your local development files.

### **`assets watch-module`**

Watch a JavaScript/React package for changes, and automatically rebuild the package.

This command is useful if you are developing a React package (e.g. React-Searchkit).

Before watching a React package, it must be installed and linked. This can be done with the `assets install` command. If the package is not already installed and linked you can use the `-l`/`--link` option.

**Options**

- `-l`/`--link` Install and link the JavaScript/React package before watching for changes.

!!! info
The command `assets watch-module` only rebuilds the JavaScript/React package into InvenioRDM's Webpack project. However, before you can
see the changes, you must also rebuild InvenioRDM's Webpack project. Hence, you normally always use `assets watch-module` and `assets watch` in together:

        invenio-cli assets watch-module --link ~/src/react-invenio-deposit
        invenio-cli assets watch

## Container commands

Containers management commands.

The container management commands intends to bring up a full infrastructure environment for **development purposes** that looks similar to your production environment.

| Command | Description                                     | Supported |
| :------ | :---------------------------------------------- | :-------: |
| build   | Build application and service images.           |  v0.19.0  |
| destroy | Destroy containerized services and application. |  v0.19.0  |
| setup   | Setup containerized services.                   |  v0.19.0  |
| start   | Start containerized services and application.   |  v0.19.0  |
| status  | Checks if the services are up and running.      |  v0.19.0  |
| stop    | Stop containerized services and application.    |  v0.19.0  |

The container management commands uses Docker-Compose behind the scenes, and
specifically relies on the `docker-compose.full.yml` file.

### **`containers build`**

Build the application and service images.

**Options**

- `--pull` / `--no-pull` Download newer versions of the image. Defaults to pull.
- `--cache` / `--no-cache` Use or do not use the cache when building images. Defaults to using the cache.

### **`containers destroy`**

Destroy the containerized services and application.

### **`containers setup`**

Setup containerized services.

By default this command will build and boot all the containerized services (see `--stop-services` and `--no-services` options below to control this behaviour).

This command:

- Initialize and create the database, Elasticsearch indexes, cache and message queue.
- Create an admin role.
- Create a default location for files.

!!! warning "Error (psycopg2.OperationalError) FATAL: role "xxx" does not exist"

    To avoid misleading error messages like this, make sure Postgres is not installed locally (and using port 5432) when setting up the database container.

**Options**

- `-f`, `--force` Force recreation of database tables, Elasticsearch indexes and queues.
- `-n`, `--no-demo-data` Disable the creation of demo data.
- `--stop-services` Stop containers after setup.
- `-s`, `--services` / `-n`, `--no-services` Boot up or not the containerized services. Defaults to boot them up.

### **`containers start`**

Start the containerized services and application.

**Options**

- `--lock` / `--skip-lock` Lock Python dependencies (defaults to `--skip-lock`).
- `--build` / `--no-build` Build images (defaults to `--no-build`).
- `--setup` / `--no-setup` Setup services (defaults to `--no-setup`).
- `--demo-data` / `--no-demo-data` Create demo records if `--setup` is specified. (default=True).
- `-s`, `--services` / `-n`, `--no-services` Boot up or not the containerized services. Defaults to booting them up.

This command is intended to only start the containers needed to run a full containerised instance, for example:

```bash
invenio-cli containers start
```

However, for demo/preview purposes it allows to perform a full build and setup. For instance, if you have a freshly initialized instance you can build and boot it with:

```bash
invenio-cli containers start --lock --build --setup
```

Note, that `--lock` is done locally on your machine, and not inside the containers.

### **`containers status`**

Checks if the services are up and running.

!!! info "Supported services"
currently only ES, DB (postgresql/mysql) and redis are supported.

**Options**

- `-v`, `--verbose` Verbose mode will show all logs in the console.

### **`containers stop`**

Stop containerized services and application.

## Packages commands

Commands for Python package management.

| Command  | Description                                                        | Supported |
| :------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------- | :-------: |
| install  | Install one or a list of Python packages in the local environment. |  v0.19.0  |
| lock     | Lock Python dependencies.                                          |  v0.19.0  |
| outdated | Show outdated Python dependencies.                                 |     -     |
| update   | Update a single Python python package.                             |     -     |

### **`packages install`**

Install one or more Python packages as editable packages in the local Python virtual environment.

The primary intended purpose of this command is for developers to install a development version of an Invenio module they are working on.

!!! warning "Don't skip assets rebuild"

    The command by default rebuilds the assets afterwards (same as running ``assets build``). If you skip rebuilding the assets, you will likely have outdated files in InvenioRDM's Webpack project, and you are very likely going to have problems.

**Options**

- `-s`, `--skip-build` Do not rebuild the assets.

### **`packages lock`**

Lock Python dependencies.

This creates a `Pipfile.lock` in your instance with hashes and versions of all
Python packages. This ensures you have reproducible builds, and that you don't risk
having new patch-level versions of third-party Python packages break your build.

**Options**

- `--pre` Allows the installation of alpha releases.
- `--dev` Include development devepencies.

### **`packages outdated`**

!!! error "Not yet supported"

### **`packages update`**

!!! error "Not yet supported"

## Services commands

Commands for services management.

The services management commands intends to bring up a minimal infrastructure environment for **development purposes**.

| destroy | Destroy development services.              |  v0.19.0  |
| setup   | Setup local services.                      |  v0.19.0  |
| start   | Start local services.                      |  v0.19.0  |
| status  | Checks if the services are up and running. |  v0.19.0  |
| stop    | Stop local services.                       |  v0.19.0  |
