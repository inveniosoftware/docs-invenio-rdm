## Login via institutional account
InvenioRDM makes it easy to integrate your
    institutional authentication provider such as e.g. Keycloak, OAuth or alternative
    use e.g. ORCID for login.

## Restricted records
InvenioRDM supports restricting access to files only
  or to the entire record.

## Share by link
Restricted records can be shared with peer-reviewers or
  your colleagues via secret links.

## Embargo support
Restricted records can be embargoed so that they are
  automatically made publicly on a specific date so that you can comply with
  e.g. funders' Open Access mandates.

## Logged in devices
InvenioRDM allows users to see a list of currently
  logged in devices on their account.
