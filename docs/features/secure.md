summary: Integrate with your authentication provider, restrict access to records or share them by secret links are just some of the secure features that InvenioRDM supports.

---

## Login via institutional account

InvenioRDM makes it easy to integrate your institutional authentication provider such as e.g. Keycloak, OAuth or can alternatively
use e.g. ORCID for login.

## Restricted records

InvenioRDM supports restricting access to files only or to the entire record.

## Share by link

Restricted records can be shared with peer-reviewers or your colleagues via secret links.

## Embargo support

Restricted records can be embargoed so that they are automatically made publicly on a specific date so that you can comply with e.g. funders' Open Access mandates.

## Logged in devices

InvenioRDM allows users to see a list of currently logged in devices on their account.

## Security policy

InvenioRDM development process focuses on developing a secure product, and we have a well-defined and tested security policy for reporting, fixing and announcing  vulnerabilities when they occur.
