# Configuration

InvenioRDM can be configured via:

- Configuration file (``invenio.cfg``)
- Environment variables

## Configuration file

In the created project folder you'll find the ``invenio.cfg`` configuration file.
It already has some options set and documented that you can change.

The ``invenio.cfg`` file is good for default and site-wide configuration - i.e. options that are the same no matter if you deploy in a test/sandbox system, a local installation or a production system. Examples include for instance the site name or the default language.

The ``invenio.cfg`` file is included in the Docker image, which means that if you change it, you will also have to rebuild the image.

!!! info
    The configuration file is a Python module, and thus follows standard Python syntax.

    - It doesn’t allow for Python syntax errors.
    - It can assign settings dynamically using normal Python syntax
    - It can import values from other configuration files.

## Environment variables

InvenioRDM can also be configured via environment variables. The environment variables are good for deployment specific options that changes for each for every running version. Examples include the database host and credentials and the application's secret key.

To set a environment variable configuration, you should prefix the configuration variable with ``INVENIO_``. Below is an example of setting the ``SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI`` variable:

```bash
export INVENIO_SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI="postgresql+psycopg2://my-site:my-site@localhost/my-site"
```

!!! info
    Environment variables takes precedence over values in the ``invenio.cfg`` configuration file.


## Options

---
### ``APP_ALLOWED_HOSTS``

Invenio has a configuration option called ``APP_ALLOWED_HOSTS`` which controls which hosts/domain names that can be served. A client request to a web server usually includes the domain name in the Host HTTP header:

```
GET /
Host: example.org
...
```

The web server uses that for instance to host several website on the same domain. Also, the host header is usually used in a load balanced environment to generate links with the right domain name.

An attacker has full control of the host header and can thus change it to whatever they like, and for instance have the application generate links to a completely different domain.

Normally your load balancer/web server should only route requests with a white-listed set of host to your application. It is however very easy to misconfigure this in your web server, and thus Invenio includes a protective measure.

Simply set APP_ALLOWED_HOSTS to a list of allowed hosts/domain names:

```
APP_ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['www.example.org']
```

---
### ``SECRET_KEY``

Probably the most important security measure is to have a strong random secret key set for you Invenio instance. The secret key is used for instance to sign user session ids and encrypt certain database fields.

The secret key must be kept secret. If the key is leaked or stolen somehow, you should immediately change it to a new key.

```python
SECRET_KEY = '..put a long random value here..'
```

Good practices:

- Never commit your secret key in the source code repository (or any other password for that sake).
- Use different secret keys for different deployments (testing, staging, production)

---
### ``WSGI_PROXIES``

Invenio is commonly used with both a load balancer and a web server in front of the application server. The load balancer and web server both works as proxies, which means that the clients remote address usually get’s added in the X-Forwarded-For HTTP header. Invenio will automatically extract the clients IP address from the HTTP header, however to prevent clients from doing IP spoofing you need to specify exactly how many proxies you have in front of you application server:

```
WSGI_PROXIES = 2
```
