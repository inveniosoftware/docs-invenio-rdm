_Introduced in InvenioRDM v12_

This section allows you to provide detailed publication metadata for your upload, depending on whether it is a journal article, a book chapter/report, or a thesis.
These fields are particularly valuable for universities, research institutes, and repositories that manage theses, journal articles, and reports, as they support accurate metadata capture for institutional reporting, discovery, and interoperability.
