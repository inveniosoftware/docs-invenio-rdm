**Audience**: End-users

InvenioRDM gives you full control over your records.

## Deposit metadata-only records

A metadata-only record is a record that contains only descriptive metadata, and no associated files. These types of records can be useful in cases where the resource does not have a corresponding digital object or its files are hosted elsewhere.

The site administrator can choose to enable or disable the creation of metadata-only records. For more on that, see [this section](../operate/customize/metadata/metadata_only.md).

To mark a record as metadata-only, simply select the "Metadata-only record" checkbox when creating a new record:

## Restrict records

A record can be marked as restricted in order to restrict its access to specific users. This is useful for example to share a record with a colleague or team before making it public.

### Setting a record to be restricted

When creating or editing a record, click the "Restricted" checkbox under "Full record" in the "Visibility" section of the form to make the entire record -metadata and files- restricted:

![Visibility Options](../imgs/records/visibility_options.png)

To **only** make the files restricted, click the "Restricted" checkbox under "Files only" in the "Visibility" section.
