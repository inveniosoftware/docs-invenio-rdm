# Upload

You can deposit new records into InvenioRDM by using the **upload form**. To begin, click the "**New upload**" button or link.

This action will open the **deposit form page**, where you can:

- **Select the files** you wish to upload.
- **Fill in the necessary metadata information** about your record.
- **Define access restrictions** to control who can view and access your content.

Once you save your record as a draft for the first time, you gain access to additional features. You can then **preview how your record will appear** on its landing page by using the **Preview** button, and you can also **share it with colleagues** for feedback or collaboration before final publication.

## Metadata-only records

A metadata-only record is a record that contains only descriptive metadata, and no associated files. These types of records can be useful in cases where the resource does not have a corresponding digital object or its files are hosted elsewhere.

The site administrator can choose to enable or disable the creation of metadata-only records. For more on that, see [this section](../operate/customize/metadata/metadata_only.md).

To mark a record as metadata-only, simply select the "Metadata-only record" checkbox when creating a new record:

## Restrict records

A record can be marked as restricted in order to restrict its access to specific users. This is useful for example to share a record with a colleague or team before making it public.

When creating or editing a record, click the "Restricted" checkbox under "Full record" in the "Visibility" section of the form to make the entire record -metadata and files- restricted:

![Visibility Options](../imgs/records/visibility_options.png)

To **only** make the files restricted, click the "Restricted" checkbox under "Files only" in the "Visibility" section.

For a deeper understanding of the high-level architecture behind records, **refer to the dedicated documentation page** located [here](../maintenance/architecture/records.md).

## Add-on metadata fields

InvenioRDM offers **add-on metadata fields** that are not enabled by default. To utilize these, you will need to **add them to your configuration**. These specialized fields are designed for specific publication types, including:

- **Journal articles**
- **Book chapters/reports**
- **Theses**

These add-on fields are particularly valuable for institutions like **universities, research institutes, and repositories** that manage diverse scholarly outputs.

In order to add those fields to record metadata of your instance follow this [guide](../../operate/customize/metadata/custom_fields/publication-information-config.md).

## Submit to a community

When you are uploading a new record, you have the option to select a community for submission. If you choose a community, the "Publish" button will automatically change to "Submit for review."

![Upload to a community](../imgs/records/upload-community.jpg)

When you submit a new draft record to a community, InvenioRDM automatically **creates a new review request**. This allows the community members to review your submission and decide whether to accept it into their community.

![Draft review](../imgs/records/records-review.jpg)

**Until the review request is accepted**, your draft record remains private. It will **only be visible to you (the uploader) and the members of that specific community**.
