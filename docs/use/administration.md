# Administration

This page provides a usage overview of the InvenioRDM administration panel.

**Audience**: Instance staff / Content Managers / Administrators

The administration panel is a feature in InvenioRDM introduced in v10 that provides a graphical user interface for managing your instance. It is designed to be used by administrators and superusers of the repository.
For more technical details you can read the [developer guide to the InvenioRDM administration panel](../maintenance/internals/administration_panel.md), detailing its programmatic interface and usage.

**As an administrator** you can access the administration panel at `/administration`. This is also available through the user menu in the top right corner of your instance:

## Site Management

### OAI-PMH

The **OAI-PMH** page allows you to manage sets used for metadata harvesting via the OAI-PMH protocol. Sets are defined by search queries and help external systems harvest records.

![OAI-PMH Sets](./imgs/administration/oai-pmh.png)

You can:

- View existing OAI-PMH sets and their search queries
- Edit or delete existing sets
- Create new sets

  ![Create OAI-PMH Set](./imgs/administration/create-oai-pmh.png)

!!! info

    For API usage, see [REST API – OAI-PMH Sets](../reference/rest_api_oaipmh_sets.md).
    For details, see [OAI-PMH](../reference/oai_pmh.md).

### Pages

The **Pages** section allows you to manage static informational pages on your site.

![Pages](./imgs/administration/pages.png)

You can:

- View the list of existing pages
- Edit existing page content, titles, language and description.

!!! info

    To learn how to customize static pages, see [Static Pages](../operate/customize/static_pages.md).

### Domains

The **Domains** section allows you to **manage and configure approved email domains** for your InvenioRDM instance.
These domains are particularly useful for **content moderation**, when moderation features are enabled. For example, you can configure your system to automatically verify and approve content uploaded by users whose email addresses originate from an approved domain.

You can:

- View domain status and user activity (e.g. active, inactive, confirmed)
- Filter by status, flagged state, or top-level domain
- Create, edit, or delete domain entries

![Domains](./imgs/administration/domains.png)

!!! info

    You can read more about [below](#moderation-of-users-and-records).

### Banners

The **Banners** section allows you to add announcement banners to your InvenioRDM instance. Banners can be displayed site-wide or targeted to specific pages.

#### Adding a new banner

**As an administrator**, you can use the **Banners** section in the administration panel to add new banners.

Banners can be added globally or restricted to a specific path. When you open the section, you'll see an overview of all banners currently added to your instance. In the example below, the list is empty because no banners have been created yet.

![Banners page](./imgs/banners/empty_banners_page.png)

To add a new banner, you can click the green "Create" button in the top right corner. This will take you to the form where you can add all the details for your new banner:

![New banner form](./imgs/banners/new_banner_form.png)

Here you can see that the first field "Start time" is already pre-filled, however, you are free to update this to whatever start date and time you want. Note that both the start and end time need to be specified in UTC format.

- "Start time" (UTC format) is when your banner will become visible on your site.
- "End time" (UTC format) is when your banner will deactivate automatically.
- "Message" is the content that will show in your banner.
- "URL path" lets you specify where your banner should be visible. If left empty, the banner will show on every page of your site. If you specify a subpath, e.g. `/records`, the banner will show only on `/records` **and all its subpages** e.g. `/records/1234`.
- "Category" is where you can define the theme of your banner. Info - blue, Warning - orange, Other - gray.
- "Active" needs to be checked to activate the banner. This ensures that the banner will show on the given start time and deactivate on the given end time. If left unchecked, the start and end times will be ignored, and the banner will not be visible. This can be used to deactivate the banner temporarily, or permanently.

In the following example, the banner will show up on all subpages of `/records` as an info banner between April 3, 2023, at 12:00 and May 3, 2023, at 12:00.

![Filled banner form](./imgs/banners/filled_banner_form.png)

When ready, click save and you will be taken back to the "Banners" page where the new banner will appear in the list:

![Banner in list](./imgs/banners/banner_added_list.png)

The list is searchable and can be filtered by selecting an option from the dropdown next to the search bar, above the list of banners.

From the list you can see the key details of your banners, and whether they are active or not. You can also edit a banner by clicking the "Edit" button in the "Actions" column, or delete it by clicking the trash can.

Clicking the link in the "ID" column will take you to a details page where you can see more details of the selected banner:

![Banner details](./imgs/banners/banner_details.png)

Now that the banner is enabled, visiting any page under `/records` within the specified date range, will show the banner above the header:

![Banner on page](./imgs/banners/banner_on_page.png)

If you have multiple active banners at the same time, they will simply stack on top of each other:

![Double banner on page](./imgs/banners/double_banner.png)

### Vocabulary Types

The **Vocabulary Types** section allows administrators to view and manage controlled vocabularies used across the repository. These vocabularies ensure consistent metadata, such as contributor roles, languages, or licenses.

You can:

- Browse available vocabulary types
- View how many entries exist in each type

![Vocabulary Types](./imgs/administration/vocabulary-types.png)

!!! info

    To customize vocabularies, see [Customize Vocabularies](../operate/customize/vocabularies/index.md).
    For API usage, see [Vocabulary REST API](../reference/rest_api_vocabularies.md).

## User Management

### Moderation of users and records

_Introduced in InvenioRDM v12_

![The User Management](imgs/user-management.png){ loading=lazy }

#### Setting up the moderation role (CLI)

To grant specific moderation permissions via the command-line interface, create and allow the role `administration-moderation`:

```shell
invenio roles create administration-moderation
invenio access allow administration-moderation role administration-moderation
```

You can assign this role to users to permit access to moderation tools.

!!! info

    See [Create and assign roles](../operate/customize/users.md#create-and-assign-roles) for more information on managing user roles.

#### User states and moderation actions

The administration panel now includes a "User management" section to deactivate, block, and delete users, as well as undo all those actions. Below is a table summarizing the hierarchy of user moderation states and their effects:

| User state       | Can create records | Can sign in | Records can be seen |
| ---------------- | ------------------ | ----------- | ------------------- |
| In good standing | ✅                 | ✅          | ✅                  |
| Deactivated      | ❌                 | ✅          | ✅                  |
| Blocked          | ❌                 | ❌          | ✅                  |
| Deleted          | ❌                 | ❌          | ❌ (Tombstones)     |

- **Deactivated users**: Temporarily prevented from creating records but can still sign in and appeal their deactivation.
- **Blocked users**: Cannot sign in anymore, but their records remain visible.
- **Deleted users**: Their records are removed from public view and replaced with a tombstone page indicating the user has been deleted.

Records can also be deleted (with a grace period for appeal or undoing) which empowers administrators to enforce institutional policies and fight spam. This leaves a [tombstone page](../reference/metadata.md#tombstone) in place of the record landing page.

Associated JSON APIs (e.g. `/api/domains`) have been added. Bulk versions of these are in the works.
