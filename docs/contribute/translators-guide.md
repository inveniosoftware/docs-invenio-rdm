## Step 4 - Learn about your translation team

- Check with the invenioRDM translation team via [Discord `#rdm-translations`](https://discord.gg/Ya7qSG43Br)
    - to get sorted within your language team.
    - to find out whether you need the [reviewer](https://docs.transifex.com/teams/understanding-user-roles#reviewers) status.

## Step 5 - Get familiar with Transifex

- Get started by:
    - [Using Transifex](https://docs.transifex.com/translation/translating-with-the-web-editor).
    - [Helpful tools in Transifex](https://docs.transifex.com/translation/tools-in-the-editor).
    - [html-context in Transifex](https://docs.transifex.com/translation/html-files).
    - [Pluralized strings in Transifex](https://docs.transifex.com/localization-tips-workflows/plurals-and-genders#how-pluralized-strings-are-handled-by-transifex).

## Step 6 - Check out workflows, experiences and advices

There are some workflows to be aware of and we collected some advices and experiences that you might find useful:

- Every change you make, should be reviewed by another member of your language team. You might need to press the `Unreview`-Button after changing a reviewed item.
- For each item you translate/review you can add comments including mentioning other members using `@name`.
- Several words/sentences appear in different places and packages. To create consistency, try to use the same translations. You might find the [transifex-inveniosoftware-Search Strings](https://www.transifex.com/inveniosoftware/search/) and its Filters helpful.

- Gender-neutral language: if the language you are translating uses different words for male, female, etc.
    - try to use a neutral way.
    - try to stick to one translation style.
- Sometimes it is hard to translate a sentence without seeing its context. If you cannot find it in the invenioRDM UI (e.g., in the [invenioRDM-demo](https://inveniordm.web.cern.ch/)) contact the invenioRDM translation team in [Discord `#rdm-translations`](https://discord.gg/Ya7qSG43Br). They can point you and show you some tricks.
