InvenioRDM is made up of a collection of modules. As you become more familiar with them,
you may want to submit your ticket to their respective repositories.

### Ask For Feature

Read through the already opened [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/inveniosoftware/product-rdm/discussions), or create a new one.
Already approved discussions and ongoing development is converted to an [issue](https://github.com/inveniosoftware/product-rdm/issues).

### Fix Bugs

Look through the GitHub issues for bugs. Anything tagged with "bug"
is open to whoever wants to implement it.

Follow the module's `CONTRIBUTING.md` file to ensure you are adhering to our process.

### Implement Features

Look through the GitHub issues for features. Anything tagged with "good first issue"
is a good place to start. Otherwise, reach out on the [chat](https://discord.gg/8qatqBC) and ask.

Just as for fixing bugs, follow the module's `CONTRIBUTING.md` for the practical details.

### Write Documentation

InvenioRDM could always use more documentation, whether as part of these
official docs, in docstrings, or even on the web in blog posts,
articles, and such.

### Translations

InvenioRDM is used all over the world, but not yet translated to all languages.
You can make InvenioRDM even more accessible by joining the translation team
and helping with translations. Follow the guide [here](translators-guide.md).

### Submit Feedback

The best way to send feedback is to file an issue at
[https://github.com/inveniosoftware/invenio-app-rdm/issues](https://github.com/inveniosoftware/invenio-app-rdm/issues)
or reply to the month's release on our [Discourse forum](https://invenio-talk.web.cern.ch/c/projects/invenio-rdm/).

If you are proposing a feature:

* Explain in detail how it would work.
* Keep the scope as narrow as possible, to make it easier to implement.
* Remember that this is a volunteer-driven project, and that contributions
  are welcome :)
