# Contribute to InvenioRDM

InvenioRDM is a vibrant open-source project with a community spanning the globe.
We cover almost all time zones during our major online workshops! Here we highlight
how you can contribute and how we work.

Contributions are welcome, and they are greatly appreciated! Every
little bit helps, and credit will always be given.

## Governance

How the project is governed is outlined [here](https://inveniosoftware.org/governance/).

## Types of Contributions

### Report Bugs and ask for features

Submit an issue at [https://github.com/inveniosoftware/invenio-app-rdm/issues](https://github.com/inveniosoftware/invenio-app-rdm/issues).
Select bug or feature and you will have a prepopulated GitHub issue created for you.
Fill it out!

InvenioRDM is made up of a collection of modules. As you become more familiar with them,
you may want to submit your ticket to their respective repositories.

### Fix Bugs

Look through the GitHub issues for bugs. Anything tagged with "bug"
is open to whoever wants to implement it.

Follow the module's `CONTRIBUTING.md` file to ensure you are adhering to our process.

### Implement Features

Look through the GitHub issues for features. Anything tagged with "good first issue"
is a good place to start. Otherwise, reach out on the [chat](https://discord.gg/8qatqBC) and ask.

Just as for fixing bugs, follow the module's `CONTRIBUTING.md` for the practical details.

### Write Documentation

InvenioRDM could always use more documentation, whether as part of these
official docs, in docstrings, or even on the web in blog posts,
articles, and such.

### Submit Feedback

The best way to send feedback is to file an issue at
[https://github.com/inveniosoftware/invenio-app-rdm/issues](https://github.com/inveniosoftware/invenio-app-rdm/issues)
or reply to the month's release on our [Discourse forum](https://invenio-talk.web.cern.ch/c/projects/invenio-rdm/).

If you are proposing a feature:

* Explain in detail how it would work.
* Keep the scope as narrow as possible, to make it easier to implement.
* Remember that this is a volunteer-driven project, and that contributions
  are welcome :)
