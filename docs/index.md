Welcome to the InvenioRDM project!

InvenioRDM is a ready-to-go Research Data Management web application putting
together the Invenio framework so you don't have to.

This documentation walks you through installing, developing and deploying
your very own InvenioRDM instance. Follow the below sections in order to get a
full picture of using InvenioRDM or go straight to what you're interested in -
each section is independent.


## Install

To get started with InvenioRDM, you will want to install `invenio-cli`, our
command line tool for creating and updating your instance. This tool in turn
allows you to easily install an instance and manage it.
