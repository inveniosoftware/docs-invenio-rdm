# DOI registration

!!! info

    The DOI registration feature requires that you have a contract with [DataCite](https://datacite.org/feemodel.html). In addition, you will also need a [DataCite test account](https://support.datacite.org/docs/getting-a-test-account) to test the feature.

## Configure

#### Enable DOI registration

You enable the DOI minting feature in your ``invenio.cfg`` file:

```python
DATACITE_ENABLED = True
```

#### Credentials and prefix

Before you continue, make sure you first have a [DataCite test account](https://support.datacite.org/docs/getting-a-test-account).

You need to provide the account credentials and the DOI prefix for the DataCite repository account in your ``invenio.cfg`` file:

```python
DATACITE_USERNAME = "..." # Your username
DATACITE_PASSWORD = "..."  # Your password
DATACITE_PREFIX = "10.1234"  # Your prefix
```

!!! tip

    Never commit or store credentials in a source code repository.

#### Mode: Test or production

InvenioRDM by default uses the [DataCite Test Environment](https://support.datacite.org/docs/testing-guide) to avoid accidentally
registering DOIs during test. In test mode InvenioRDM will use the following DataCite test systems:

- DOI Fabrica (https://doi.test.datacite.org).
- REST API (https://api.test.datacite.org).

To enable production mode, set the following configuration variable in ``invenio.cfg``:

```python
DATACITE_TEST_MODE = False
```

In production mode, InvenioRDM will use the following DataCite systems:

- DOI Fabrica (https://doi.datacite.org).
- REST API (https://api.datacite.org).


!!! tip "Did you know?"

    You can write your own persistent identifier plugin in InvenioRDM to support other types of persistent identifiers.

#### Generated DOI

By default, InvenioRDM generates a DOI using the prefix and internal persistent
identifier. You can change the generated DOI string by editing your ``invenio.cfg``.

```python
DATACITE_FORMAT = "{prefix}/inveniordm.{id}"
```

!!! tip

    Before branding your DOIs, please read about
    [Cool DOIs](https://doi.org/10.5438/55e5-t5c0) and why it might not be a
    good idea.


#### OAI-PMH

The OAI-PMH server's metadata format ``oai_datacite`` that allows you to harvest record from InvenioRDM in DataCite XML needs to be configured with your DataCite data center symbol. This is only required if you want your records to be harvestable in DataCite XML format.

```python
DATACITE_DATACENTER_SYMBOL = "CERN.INVENIORDM"
```


### Versioning end externally managed DOI

By default, InvenioRDM allows versioning for any DOI type - internally or externally managed. Internally managed DOI is a DOI which is given thanks to InvenioRDM feature which allows us to configure the DOI registration on DataCite (check #Enable DOI registration). The external DOIs are not minted by our instance and in some cases repository manager decides to disallow versioning of records identified by external DOI. To disable versioning for external DOIs you need to set:

```python
RDM_ALLOW_EXTERNAL_DOI_VERSIONING = False
```

## Known issues

- **Restricted records:** DOIs are registered for all records including restricted
  records, thus metadata like titles, authors, description and more is sent to
  DataCite Metadata registry where it is public. Provide an external DOI if
  no DOI should be registered by InvenioRDM.
