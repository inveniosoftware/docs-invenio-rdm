# URN registration

*Available since InvenioRDM v11*

!!! info

    The URN registration feature requires that you have a contract with the German National Library ([DNB](https://wiki.dnb.de/display/URNSERVDOK/URN-Service+API). You will need to contact urn-support@dnb.de to get an account for the sandbox and the production REST-API.

In order to register URN's with InvenioRDM you need to add two modules to your instance.
