# Names

Names are a specific type of vocabulary, which represent a records' creator
or contributor. For example, the deposit form offers _search as you type_
suggestions and auto-fills the corresponding information.

You can find information behind the design and usage of the vocabulary in
[RFC 0054](https://github.com/inveniosoftware/rfcs/pull/54).

## Data model

A _Name_ record contains:

- The name of the author splitted in `family name` and `given name`, or a
  single `name` attribute with the full name formatted as
  `<family name>, <given name>`. Note that if `family name` and `given name`
  are present they will overwrite `name`.
- A list of `identifiers`, composed by their identifier value and scheme.
  The scheme can potentially be autocompleted if it is known by the _idutils_
  library (e.g. ORCiD).
- A list of `affiliations`, which can be represented by its `name` or, if it
  belongs to the _Affiliations_ vocabulary, by its `id`.

```yaml
- family_name: Carberry
  given_name: Josiah
  identifiers:
    - identifier: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1825-0097
      scheme: orcid
  affiliations:
    - name: Wesleyan University
- name: Haak, Laurel L
  identifiers:
    - identifier: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5109-3700
  affiliations:
    - id: 04fa4r544
```

### How to import and update your name records

The Names vocabulary uses the new DataStreams API for processing vocabularies.
You can find more information about this new API in
[RFC 0053](https://github.com/inveniosoftware/rfcs/pull/53).

!!! warning "Use of the `vocabularies` command"
    Name records will not be managed by the usual
    `invenio rdm-records fixtures` command, but instead
    a set of `invenio vocabularies ...` commands.

There are several ways to import names records. The most straight forward
is by a DataStream definition file, where you will define how entries from a
data source will be **read**, if they need any **transformation**, and finally
where they should be **written** to.

For a simple import you can **read** entries from a YAML file with raw metadata
objects, skip **transformations**, and use a service API to **write** and
persist the entries to the database. Here is an example of this definition
file, lets call it `vocabularies-future.yaml`:

```yaml
names:
  reader:
    type: yaml
    args:
      origin: "./app_data/names.yaml"
  writers:
    - type: service
      args:
        service_or_name: rdm-names
        identity: system_identity
```

Finally, to run an **import** using this `vocabularies-future.yaml` file you
can call the `vocabularies import` command:

```shell
invenio vocabularies import \
  --vocabulary names \
  --filepath ./vocabularies-future.yaml
```

In addition, you can also **update** vocabulary records in case you updated the
source data file using the `vocabularies update` command:

```bash
invenio vocabularies update \
  --vocabulary names \
  --filepath ./vocabularies-future.yaml
```

### Creating a `names.yaml` file

The Names vocabulary has been implemented with the
[ORCiD public dataset](https://orcid.figshare.com/articles/dataset/ORCID_Public_Data_File_2021/16750535?file=31020067)
as a possible source to import entries from. This means that the functionality
to **read** entries from this format is already available. For example, you
can use the `vocabularies convert` command to convert this dataset into a YAML
file with the appropriate names metadata format:

```bash
invenio vocabularies convert \
  --vocabulary names \
  --origin /path/to/ORCID_2021_10_summaries.tar.gz \
  --target names.yaml
```

Alternatively, you can simply import it directly:

!!! warning "Long and blocking operation"
    Note that the import process is done synchronously and the ORCiD dataset is
    very large. Therefore, this operation can take a long time.

```bash
invenio vocabularies import \
  --vocabulary names \
  --origin /path/to/ORCID_2021_10_summaries.tar.gz
```
