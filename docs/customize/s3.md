# S3 as Storage backend

## I chose S3 when initializing the repository!

!!! warning "S3 selected"
    This section assumes you chose S3 when bootstrapping the instance.

If you are reading this section, you are lucky! You will only have to perform a few configuration changes.

### Bucket and data location

A default bucket (`data`) is created automatically in your minio container. This bucket will be used as the default files' location for your InvenioRDM instance.

### Set your credentials

The last step is to set your credentials so your instance can authenticate against the S3 container.

By default, the `ROOT_USER` and the `ROOT_USER_PASSWORD` of MinIO are "CHANGE_ME". For security reasons, you should change them. This will require you to:

- Stop your services by using the CLI: `invenio-cli services stop` (Or stop only your minio container).
- In the `docker-services.yaml` file change the `MINIO_ROOT_USER` and `MINIO_ROOT_PASSWORD` values.
- Update the credentials in the `invenio.cfg` file: The root user value corresponds to `S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and the password to `S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`.
- Start your services: `invenio-cli services start`.

It's done! Ready to roll!
