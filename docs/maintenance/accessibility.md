# Accessibility

## Intended audience

This guide is intended for maintainers and developers of InvenioRDM itself.

## Accessibility Goal 

The goal is to ensure that the web application and its content can be used by those with diverse hearing, movement, sight, and cognitive abilities.

InvenioRDM adheres to the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 AA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/). These guidelines provide testable success criteria, described by 4 principles.

## Principles

Content and functionality should be Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, and Robust for all.  (POUR is the mnemonic.)

- **Perceivable**
The user can perceive the site – either see it, hear it, or feel it (in the case of haptics or braille.) 
- **Operable**
The user can operate and control the interface using their chosen technologies – be it desktop browser with mouse and keyboard, mobile touchscreen device, screen reader, keyboard only, switches. 
- **Understandable**
The user can understand the site, because it is consistent, both internally and with common design patterns. It is appropriate to the audience in its voice and tone.  
- **Robust**
The technology is standards-compliant and performant.  

## Testing

Some criteria can be tested with freely available tools. Other criteria will require manual review.
We recommend all contributors test their code using the [Lighthouse Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/lighthouse/blipmdconlkpinefehnmjammfjpmpbjk?hl=en) before submitting PRs.
