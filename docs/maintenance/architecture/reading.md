Experienced InvenioRDM developers that want to improve their software architecture skills.

### What to expect

If you want to improve your architecture skills, the following books and websites are good
sources of *inspiration*.

By no means are any of these books architecture bibles. Blind and
uncritical application of any of the patterns and methods described have a high probability
of failure.

Our best advice to get started on architecture is to begin articulating and writing down
your underlying guiding principles, defining clear names and expressing responsibilities and boundaries
of your architecture.
