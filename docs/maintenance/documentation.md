## Guidelines

### Before starting

- Set up a spell checker in your IDE, even better a "writing assistant" (popular ones [LanguageTool](https://languagetool.org/), [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com/)).
- Determine what your audience needs to learn, fit documentation to your audience.

### When writing

- Write in the second person. Refer to your audience as “you” rather than “we”.
- Create great opening sentences that establish a paragraph's central point.
- Prefer active voice to passive voice: `The mat was sat on by the cat.` -> `The cat sat on the mat.`
- Prefer task-based headings.
- Prefer list to long sentences. Use a numbered list when ordering is important and a bulleted list when ordering is irrelevant.
- Explain and give information progressively.
- Usage sections should feel like tutorials that call the user to action - e.g. "create a mapping".
- In tutorials, reinforce concepts with examples, note problems that readers may encounter.

### When completed

- Read documents out loud (to yourself).
- Ask for review.
- When using MkDocs, run the live server and verify that the page renders correctly (e.g. code snippets).
