# Release management

**Intended audience**

This guide is intended for maintainers and developers of InvenioRDM itself.

**Scope**

The guide covers how to release a new version of InvenioRDM.

## Overview

We follow [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/). In particular:

- ``0.y.z`` is for initial development - anything may change at any time.

InvenioRDM consists of:

- a CLI tool, [invenio-cli](https://github.com/inveniosoftware/invenio-cli)
- an instance template, [cookiecutter-invenio-rdm](https://github.com/inveniosoftware/cookiecutter-invenio-rdm)
- an application, [invenio-app-rdm](https://github.com/inveniosoftware/invenio-app-rdm)
- [many modules](../modules.md)

### Tool versioning

The ``invenio-cli`` tool is intended to be able to work with many different application versions, and multiple products (RDM, ILS, ...), and is therefore independently versioned.

### Application versioning

The instance template (cookiecutter-invenio-rdm) and the application (invenio-app-rdm) are together considered the application and therefore versioned together.

The application locks each dependent module to their major-level versions so that patches can be distributed without breaking compatibility.

### Module versioning

Each module (e.g. invenio-rdm-records, invenio-records, ...) is versioned independently. Each module MUST follow semantic versioning, so that the application can lock the module version to the major-level release.

    - bump invenio-rdm-records
    - bump react-invenio-deposit
    - bump react-invenio-forms
- cookiecutter-invenio-rdm [GitHub](https://github.com/inveniosoftware/cookiecutter-invenio-rdm)
    - bump invenio-app-rdm

For modules in ``v0.X.Y``, the new version is ``v0.(X+1).0``.

For modules in ``vX.Y.Z``, the new version is ``v(X+1).0.0.dev0``.

### Pre-release

- Ensure all dependent modules have been released.
- Release invenio-app-rdm (removing the pre-release suffix - e.g. ``dev0``).
- cookiecutter-invenio-rdm:
    - Merge everything to ``master``.
    - Create a new version branch from ``master`` using the pattern ``vX.Y`` (e.g., if Invenio-App-RDM is v1.0.0, then the branch should be named ``v1.0``).
- Write release notes on https://github.com/inveniosoftware/docs-invenio-rdm and merge them onto the master branch. Check the [dev site](https://inveniordm-dev.docs.cern.ch).

### Release

The final steps to release the new modules and source code are to release invenio-cli and reset the documentation's ``production`` branch to the `master` one. Releasing invenio-cli, will make all new installation use the latest released packages.

- invenio-cli:
    - Update cookiecutter-invenio-rdm branch version in the source code.
    - Bump version of invenio-cli and release.

- docs-invenio-rdm:
    - Do a final pass on the new version's release notes.
    - Update if need be the release announcement on the [homepage of this site](../../index.md).
    - Reset ``production`` by cutting from the ``master`` branch.

### Post-release

- [Deploy InvenioRDM](demosite.md) to QA and PROD (demo website AND docs).
- Write a blog post for https://inveniosoftware.org/blog/ .
- Website update
    - Update [public roadmap](https://inveniosoftware.org/products/rdm/roadmap/).
    - Review project information.
    - Subtitle under <https://inveniosoftware.org/products/rdm/> title.
- Project tracking:
    - GitHub: Update [internal product roadmap](https://github.com/inveniosoftware/product-rdm/milestones?direction=asc&sort=due_date&state=open).
- Create maintenance branches of supported modules. See [branch management](branch-management.md).

## Release a Python or JavaScript package

- Ensure all appropriate PR's are merged onto the ``master`` branch on GitHub.
- Create a PR with commit message "release: vX.Y.Z" and the following content:
    - a list of changes added to the ``CHANGES.md`` file
    - a bump to the version number:
        - python: ``<package>/__init__.py``
        - Javascript: ``package.json``, update ``package-lock.json``
- Create the tag
```bash
git remote update
git checkout upstream/master
```
for the version number [see above](#overview) about semantic versioning
```bash
git tag vX.Y.Z
git push upstream vX.Y.Z
```

## Maintenance releases

Maintenance releases follow the same workflow as a new version release. You
only need to replace ``master`` with ``maint-x.y`` branches.

!!! warning PyPI releases are immediately picked up

    Be aware that when the independent modules are released, they will be
    picked up immediately by new InvenioRDM installations. This should not be
    an issues since the releases MUST be backward compatible and invenio-app-rdm
    constrains its dependencies below the next untested major versions.

Details about branch workflows are covered in the next section: [Branch management](branch-management.md)
