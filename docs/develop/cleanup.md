# Cleanup after you

## Destroy the instance

Finally, we want to destroy it. This will take us to a clean state. Note that it destroys images, containers and volumes (the ones defined in the `february-release-2/docker-compose.full.yml`. ).

Stop the application:

``` console
$ invenio-cli destroy
TODO: Revisit destroy command...
```
