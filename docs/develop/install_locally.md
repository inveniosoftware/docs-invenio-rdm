# Install Locally

In the [Preview Section](../preview/index.md), we have been running all of the
application in docker containers. This saves you the trouble of installing the
instance on your host and gets something visible fast. Now, we will run the
application locally and the database and other services in containers. It's the
best compromise between getting up and running with relevant services fast, while
allowing you to iterate on your local instance quickly.

Before going on, let's move into the project directory:

``` bash
cd development-instance
```

## Install for development

To run the application locally, we will need to install it and its dependencies
first. For this release, we need to add `--pre`, since we do have to
install alpha releases. Be patient, it might take some time to build.

!!! info "Pre-requisite: FLASK_ENV is available via invenio-cli flags"
    You do not need to export `FLASK_ENV` anymore. Just call the commands with
    `--development` or `-d`. This will instruct the different commands to create
    symbolic links to your files, so the changes are easily propagated. There are
    two operations that require this flag: `install` and `update`.

``` bash
invenio-cli packages lock --pre --dev
invenio-cli install --pre --development
```

``` console
# Summarized output

As a result, the Python dependencies for the project have been installed in
a new virtualenv for the application and many of the files in your project
directory have been symlinked inside it.

## Setup the database, Elasticsearch, Redis and RabbitMQ

We need to initialize the database, the indices and so on. For this, we use
the `services` command. The first time this command is run, the services will be
setup correctly and the containers running them will even restart upon a reboot
of your machine. If you stop and restart those containers, your data will still
be there. Upon running this command again, the initial setup is skipped.

``` bash
invenio-cli services setup
```

``` console

In case you want to wipe out the data that was there (say to start fresh),
you can use `--force` and nuke the content!

``` bash
invenio-cli services setup --force
```

``` console

## (Don't) Populate the database

Demo records now come by default! If you want to avoid having them when setting up your instance, pass the `--no-demo-data` flag to the `setup` command:

```bash
invenio-cli services setup --no-demo-data
```

!!! warning "Don't do this in 0.21.0 (January release)"
    Demo data is tied to vocabulary loading in the latest release. Until the two are separate, you should not use the `--no-demo-data` as it would not load the vocabularies.
