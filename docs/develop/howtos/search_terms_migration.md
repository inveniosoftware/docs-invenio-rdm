# Create search terms mappings

This guide describes the process to create search terms mappings in the application layer.

This is particularly useful when a certain search term is not supported anymore by the search engine or we want to simplify a search term (e.g nested field), in favor of a new term.

The query is parsed in the application layer and the old term is replaced with the new one before passing the query to the search engine.

## Steps

- Identify the search term to be mapped (e.g. `q=old_term:"value"`).
- Identify the new, equivalent search term (e.g. `q=new_term:"value"`)
- Add or edit the following configuration variable in your application `invenio.cfg` file:
    ```python
    RDM_SEARCH = {
        "query_parser_cls": QueryParser.factory(
            tree_transformer_factory=SearchFieldTransformer.factory(
                mapping={
                    "old_term": "new_term"
                }
            ),
        )
    }
    ```

## Examples

- The term `resource_type.subtype` was deprecated in favor of `metadata.resource_type.props.subtype`. Therefore, the following configuration was added to `invenio.cfg`:

    ```python
    RDM_SEARCH = {
        "query_parser_cls": QueryParser.factory(
            tree_transformer_factory=SearchFieldTransformer.factory(
                mapping={
                    "resource_type.subtype": "metadata.resource_type.props.subtype"
                }
            ),
        )
    }
    ```

    The query  `/api/records/q=resource_type.subtype` is transformed into `/api/records/q=metadata.resource_type.props.subtype:<subtype>`.

- Simplify a query for a nested field. This example maps `parent.communities.ids` into a shorter term `communities`:

    ```python
    RDM_SEARCH = {
        "query_parser_cls": QueryParser.factory(
            tree_transformer_factory=SearchFieldTransformer.factory(
                mapping={
                    "communities": "parent.communities.ids"
                }
            ),
        )
    }
    ```

    The query  `/api/records/q=communities:<community_id>` is transformed into `/api/records/q=parent.communities.ids:<community_id>`.
