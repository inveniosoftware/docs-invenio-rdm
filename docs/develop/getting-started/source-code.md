# Source code

For development you need the latest ``master`` or ``main`` branch of the source
code (name depends on  the repository).

Following show you to fork the repository and checkout the source code.

### With GitHub CLI

First checkout the source code from GitHub and get the latest ``master`` or
``main``  branch (depends on the repository which name is used).

This is most easily done using the [GitHub CLI tool](https://cli.github.com):

```
# with GitHub CLI tool:
gh repo fork inveniosoftware/invenio-app-rdm
cd invenio-app-rdm
```

With the previous command, we made a checkout of [Invenio-App-RDM](https://github.com/inveniosoftware/invenio-app-rdm) module. You'll have to adapt the command to checkout the module you want to work on.

### Without GitHub CLI

Without the GitHub CLI tool, you'll first have to [fork the repository](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo)
on GitHub. Then, once you have a fork you can clone the repository and add the
upstream repository remote:

```
# without GitHub CLI:
git clone https://github.com/<your username>/invenio-app-rdm
cd invenio-app-rdm
git remote add upstream https://github.com/inveniosoftware/invenio-app-rdm
```

### Repositories survival guide
