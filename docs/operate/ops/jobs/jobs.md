# Jobs

_Introduced in InvenioRDM v13_

A powerful asynchronous tasks management interface called `Jobs`, giving administrators control over background tasks directly from the administration interface.

A job is a wrapper around a `Celery` task that can be scheduled, run on demand, and managed via the administration interface. You can also monitor the execution status of each job, run history, and logs.
