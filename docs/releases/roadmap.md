# Roadmap

## Public roadmap

We publish our public roadmap on:

- [https://inveniosoftware.org/products/rdm/roadmap/](https://inveniosoftware.org/products/rdm/roadmap/)

##  Development schedule (restricted to InvenioRDM partners)

If you're a partner of the InvenioRDM project, you can get access to our internal
development schedule. The schedule is available on:

- [https://github.com/orgs/inveniosoftware/projects/80](https://github.com/orgs/inveniosoftware/projects/80)

To gain access (if you're an InvenioRDM partner), please send your GitHub handle to [info@inveniosoftware.org](mailto:info@inveniosoftware.org)

**What's the difference?**

The public roadmap communicates clearly the inherent uncertainty in our planned schedule coming from developing a product as a large open source collaboration. The internal development schedule on the other hand is a coordination and planning tool and not a roadmap.
