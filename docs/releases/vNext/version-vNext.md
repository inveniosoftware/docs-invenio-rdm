# InvenioRDM vNext

_2020-0-0_

This is a work-in-progress document to enable InvenioRDM developers to track 
new features that will be included in the next release.

We're happy to announce the release of InvenioRDM vNext, the open-source
repository platform for research data management, institutional repositories,
and digital assets management! Version Next will be maintained until at least 6 months following the next release. Visit our [maintenance policy page](../maintenance-policy.md) to learn more.

## What's new?

### New feature

### Miscellaneous additions
Here is a quick summary of the myriad of other improvements in this release:

- Admin panel Jobs: Added a "Delete" action to the Jobs list so admins can remove jobs directly from the UI.

## Deprecations

- Many [custom field widgets](../../operate/customize/metadata/custom_fields/widgets.md) used the `icon` and `description` props, which have now been deprecated and replaced with `labelIcon` and `helpText` respectively. This is to improve consistency with the naming of the built-in fields used in the deposit form and thereby avoid confusion. The old names will continue to function for now.

## Breaking changes

- Overridables in the deposit form have been modified to improve consistency in structure and naming conventions. This has involved renaming the IDs of several `<Overridable>`s, but none have been removed. If you are using these IDs to override components, please see [the full list of updates](https://github.com/inveniosoftware/invenio-rdm-records/pull/2101/files#diff-ff3c479edefad986d2fe6fe7ead575a46b086e3bbcf0ccc86d85efc4a4c63c79) and change your IDs accordingly.
