# Releases

## Release cycles

We aim to have annual releases, with security and bug fixes as well as small improvements throughout the support period of the release. This cadence is better aligned with our resources and the community's desire for stability, while still allowing for sustained changes (breaking or non-breaking).

Starting with version 12, each release is production-grade ready. Before v12, only LTS-releases were supported for usage in production.

Our aim is to ensure that users of InvenioRDM follow our latest releases by making the upgrade process a seamless experience.
