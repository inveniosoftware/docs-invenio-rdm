# Releases


## Release cycles

We aim to have a quarterly release cycle, to push out new features as fast as possible.

Only releases designated **Long-Term Support (LTS)** releases are supported for production services.

Our aim is to ensure that users of InvenioRDM follow our latest releases by making the upgrade process a seamless experience.
