## What's new?

### Creators/contributors auto-completion

InvenioRDM now supports auto-completion of creators and contributors in the upload from.

![Demo of creators/contributors auto-completion.](v8.0/creator-auto-completion.gif)

The search box is powered by a new names vocabulary, exposed under the ``/api/names`` endpoint.

It is up to each instance of InvenioRDM to populate the names vocabulary themselves with the persons they'd like to auto-complete. An InvenioRDM instance could for instance choose to import names from an institutional directory services. Out-of-the-box InvenioRDM supports importing the public data dump from ORCID so you can auto-complete from public ORCID profiles.

More about the [names vocabulary](../../customize/vocabularies/names.md).

The feature has to be enabled by adding the following in your ``invenio.cfg``:

```python
APP_RDM_DEPOSIT_FORM_AUTOCOMPLETE_NAMES = True
```

### Record landing page

The record landing page was redesigned to improve the overall readability of the record, as well as the web accessibility. Below

The changes to the landing page include:

- Responsive layout - the landing page now renders nicely on both desktop, tablets and mobiles.
- Creators/contributors improvements - contributors are now rendered horizontally to reduce whitespace usage.
- Keywords & subjects - were moved from the main section to the sidebar to make this information easily accessible for the user.
- Rights - the previous license section was renamed to rights.
- License icons - we now display icons for Creative Common licenses.
- Additional descriptions - were extracted from the details section and moved to right below the main description.
- Export - the export links were converted to a select menu with direct download to avoid having to select and copy/paste from the previous page.
- Administration buttons - the administration buttons have been moved to the right column in preparation for the communities feature launching in v9.
- Additional details  - the section was converted from a horizontal table to a tabular menu with vertical listing of the details.

### My dashboard

We have changed the header menu from "Uploads" to "My dashboard" in preparation for the communities feature launching in v9.0. The goal of the change is to provide a user with an overview of all their records, communities and requests in InvenioRDM.

This also means we have changed the URL endpoint of the uploads page from ``/uploads`` to ``/me/uploads`` so that we can later add both ``/me/communities`` and ``/me/requests``.

### OAI-PMH server improvements

The OAI-PMH server added in v7.0 has been improved so it's now a fully compliant OAI-PMH 2.0 server. The improvements include:

**Sets support**

The OAI-PMH server now has sets support which includes improvements to the underlying Invenio Framework. The improvements means that records are immediately available in the sets as soon as they have been indexed (within seconds) and that we can efficiently query which other sets a record is part if.

The sets are defined as search queries over the set of records, and currently has to be programmatically however InvenioRDM v9.0 will add a REST API for allowing administrators to manage sets.

**DataCite metadata formats**

We have added support DataCite  metadata formats in the OAI-PMH server via the ``oai_datacite`` and  ``datacite`` metadata format prefixes.

**OpenAIRE compliance**

In addition to the above features we have now also validated the OAI-PMH server against the [OpenAIRE Guidelines](https://guidelines.openaire.eu/en/latest/) to ensure the OAI-PMH server is complaint with the guidelines.

See the [OAI-PMH server documentation](../../reference/oai_pmh.md).

### Translations (I18N)

InvenioRDM v8.0 have also seen a lot of improvements on the translation front as well. We are now almost add a stage where the system is fully translated with German being the first translated language.

We aim at having finished the full translation of InvenioRDM v9 LTS. If you'd like to participate in the translation, please checkout our new guide for [getting involved as a translator](../../contribute/translators-guide.md).

### Web accessibility (A11y)

We continuing our works towards Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) level AA conformance, and have made several improvements on multiple pages. The landing page was improved for screen readers by adding aria-attributes and organising the layout into sections. Where the elements have a different purpose than styling, semantic HTML or aria-roles were added. Each section was given a heading, and it was made sure each heading has the correct level. The interactive elements were given aria-attributes, and made accessible by keyboard.

The accessibility was tested with VoiceOver and Screen Reader Chrome Plugin on MacOS.

### User experience improvements

**Search facets**

We have improve how the search facets work. It is now possible to easily clear selected facets. In addition the facets will be automatically cleared if you change the search query.

**No results search tips**

We have also improve the page shown when no search results could be found. It now includes a "ProTip" section and allows the user to easily clear the search.

### Developer documentation

We have made a larger update to our developer documentation for multiple
different skill levels whether you are a long-term contributor or a beginner.

See our new [developer documentation](../../develop/index.md).

### Code changes

**Marshmallow deprecation warnings**

A larger number of marshmallow deprecation warnings have been fixed.

**Declarative packages and entry points improvements**

Invenio Framework relies heavily on Python entry points as a mechanism for
supporting plugins and an extendable architecture. Previously these entry
points were being read by the ``pkg_resources`` package. We have started switching
packages over to using Python's ``importlib`` instead for reasons of performance.

We have also started moving packages to having a purely declarative definition
by moving most of the what was previously in ``setup.py`` into ``setup.cfg``.
This is the due to the long-term direction that Python packaging environment is
going towards, and thus this allows to gradually transition to the new method.

## Feature preview

!!! warning "Do not enable feature previews in production systems"

    **IMPORTANT**: Feature previews are not supported with upgrades or migrations, and should not be enabled in production systems.

InvenioRDM 8.0 ships with a feature preview of the new communities feature. The full communities feature is planned to launch with InvenioRDM v9.0 LTS in mid-April.

You can enable the feature preview by including the following lines in your ``invenio.cfg``:

```python
COMMUNITIES_ENABLED = True
```

Note, if the feature preview is disabled, all the associated REST API and views are disabled, and thus v8.0 can safely be used on production systems.
This will enable the communities and requests modules. You'll e.g. see the dashboard has been extended with two new tabs "Communities" and "Requests"

![View of my dashboard with feature preview enabled](v8.0/requests.png)

You'll also see in the header there's a new "Communities" item, as well as a "request inbox".

## Upgrading to v8.0

We support upgrading from v7.0 to v8.0. Please see the [upgrade notice](../upgrading/upgrade-v8.0.md).

## Maintenance policy

InvenioRDM v8.0 is a **short-term support** (STS) release which is supported until InvenioRDM v9.0 (release currently planned for mid-April 2022). See our [Maintenance Policy](../maintenance-policy.md).

If you plan to deploy InvenioRDM as a production service, please use InvenioRDM v6.0 Long-Term Support (LTS) Release.

## Requirements

InvenioRDM v8.0 supports:

- Python 3.7, 3.8 and 3.9
- PostgreSQL 10+
- Elasticsearch 7

Note that Python 3.6, Elasticsearch 6 and PostgreSQL 9 have all reached end of
life and are no longer supported by their respective organisations.

### Future breaking changes

Following is an advance notification of larger upcoming changes.

InvenioRDM v9.0 will ship with larger changes to the underlying user management modules. This changes includes:

- Moving the ``UserIdentity`` database table from Invenio-OAuthClient to Invenio-Accounts.
- Change from Flask-Security to Flask-Security-Invenio module.
- Moving user profile information from Invenio-UserProfiles to Invenio-Accounts.
- Separating login timestamps and IP addresses from the user database table.

We are still assessing if it possible and feasible to change the current user identifier from a sequential integer to a random string (UUID). This change is considered

InvenioRDM will ship with upgrade guide and data migrations, however if you write custom code, these changes may impact you.
