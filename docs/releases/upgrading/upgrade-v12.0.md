# Upgrading from v11 to v12

## Prerequisites

The steps listed in this article require an existing local installation of InvenioRDM v11.

!!! warning "Backup"

    Always backup your database and files before you try to perform an upgrade.

!!! info "Older Versions"

    In case you have an InvenioRDM installation older than v11, you can gradually upgrade
    using the existing infrastructure to v11 and afterwards continue from here.

## Upgrade Steps

!!! warning "Upgrade your invenio-cli"

    Make sure you have the latest `invenio-cli` installed. For InvenioRDM v12 it
    is at least v1.3.1

    ```bash
    $ invenio-cli --version
    invenio-cli, version 1.3.1
    ```

!!! info "Virtual environments"

    In case you are not inside a virtual environment, make sure that you prefix each `invenio`
    command with `pipenv run`.


**Local development**

Changing the Python version in your development environment highly
depends on your setup, and there is no golden rule.
One example would be to use [PyEnv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv).

!!! warning "Risk of losing data"

    Your virtual env folder may contain uploaded files. If you kept the default
    location it is in in `var/instance/data`. If you need to keep those files,
    make sure you copy them over to the new virtual env in the same location.
    The command `invenio files location list` shows the file upload location.

If you upgraded your python version, you should recreate your virtualenv before
running `invenio-cli` or `pipenv` commands below.


### Upgrade InvenioRDM

Python 3.9 or Python 3.12 are required to run InvenioRDM v12.

There are two options to upgrade your system:

#### Upgrade option 1: In-place

This approach upgrades the dependencies in place. Your virtual environment for the
v11 version will be gone afterwards.

```bash
cd <my-site>

# Upgrade to InvenioRDM v12
invenio-cli packages update 12.0.0
pipenv uninstall flask-babelex

# Re-build assets
invenio-cli assets build
```

#### Upgrade option 2: New virtual environment

This approach will create a new virtual environment and leaves the v11 as it is.
If you are using a docker image on your production instance this will be the
option you chose.

##### Step 1
- create a new virtual environment
- activate your new virtual environment
- install `invenio-cli` by `pip install invenio-cli`

##### Step 2
Update the file `<my-site>/Pipfile`.

```diff
[packages]
---invenio-app-rdm = {extras = [...], version = "~=11.0.0"}
+++invenio-app-rdm = {extras = [...], version = "~=12.0.0"}
```

Due to a dependency upgrade, update the following line.
```diff
---my-site = {editable="True", path="./site"}
+++my-site = {editable=true, path="./site"}
```

##### Step 3
Update the `Pipfile.lock` file:

```bash
invenio-cli packages lock
```

##### Step 4
Install InvenioRDM v12:

```bash
invenio-cli install
```

### Database migration

Execute the database migration:

```bash
invenio alembic upgrade
```

### Declare usage statistics processing queues

```shell
invenio queues declare
```

### Data migration

Execute the data migration:

```bash
pipenv run invenio shell $(find $(pipenv --venv)/lib/*/site-packages/invenio_app_rdm -name migrate_11_0_to_12_0.py)
```

### Rebuild search indices

```bash
invenio index destroy --yes-i-know
invenio index init
invenio rdm rebuild-all-indices
```

In v12, record statistics will be stored in search indices rather than the
database. These indices are created through some *index templates* machinery
rather than having indices registered directly in `Invenio-Search`. As such, the
search indices for statistics are not affected by `invenio index destroy
--yes-i-know` and are totally functional after the rebuild step.

### New roles

```bash
invenio roles create administration-moderation
invenio roles create administration

invenio access allow administration-moderation role administration-moderation
invenio access allow administration-access role administration
invenio access allow superuser-access role administration
```

### New configuration variables

```bash
COMMUNITIES_IDENTITIES_CACHE_REDIS_URL = "URI_TO_REDIS"
USERS_RESOURCES_ADMINISTRATION_ENABLED = True
THEME_SITENAME = "Project name for header and UI"
```

## Big Changes

- remove: dependency of flask-babelex
- add: concept doi (aka parent doi)
- add: statistics. (NOTE: statistic is stored in opensearch/libresearch)
- add: administration panel
- add: set quota
- add: branded communities
- add: share options for drafts and records
- add: built-in optional metadata fields
- change: the default delimiter for the licenses vocabulary file has been
  changed from ";" to ",". The default licenses are available
  [here](https://github.com/inveniosoftware/invenio-rdm-records/blob/master/invenio_rdm_records/fixtures/data/vocabularies/licenses.csv).
  You can now add and update licenses with `pipenv run invenio rdm-records
  add-to-fixture licenses`



## OPEN PROBLEMS

- users-user-v2.0.0 vs users-user-v1.0.0 indices
  the problem is that user-v1.0.0 does not have the `confirmed_at` attribute
  which is needed in `/api/users`.
  SOLUTION 1:
  ```bash
  invenio index destroy --yes-i-know
  invenio index init
  invenio rdm rebuild-all-indices
  ```
  SOLUTION 2:
  ```bash
  invenio index delete users-user-v1.0.0-NUMBER --force --yes-i-know
  invenio index create users-user-v2.0.0-NUMBER -b path/to/invenio_users_resources/records/mappings/os-v2/users/user-v2.0.0.json
  invenio shell
    from invenio_search.proxies import current_search_client
    current_search_client.indices.put_alias("users-user-v2.0.0-NUMBER", "users-user-v2.0.0")
    current_search_client.indices.put_alias("users-user-v2.0.0-NUMBER", "users")
    exit
  invenio rdm rebuild-all-indices -o users
  ```
