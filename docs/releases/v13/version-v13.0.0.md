## What's new?

to complete

_TODO_: the quota feature has not been documented. It should be added, with a screenshot of the admin panel.

### Jobs and ORCID/ROR

TODO
**Document the introduction of jobs and link it to the doc. Document in the upgrade notes to add the new scheduler for jobs**



We have upgraded to ROR version 2.0 and enhanced the metadata to include
organization aliases, status, types, locations, and acronym. It should be
easier to find the correct organization or funder you're looking for.

We have also enabled ROR updating using invenio-jobs, which lets you
automatically load the funders or affiliations vocabulary from the
InvenioRDM administration panel. You can also schedule to update your
vocabulary with new ROR releases on a regular schedule. You can find more
instructions on the [affiliations](../../operate/customize/vocabularies/affiliations.md)
and [funders](../../operate/customize/vocabularies/funding.md) documentation pages.

Explain about the new jobs feature, logging and ORCID/ROR jobs.

Related [new doc page](../../operate/customize/vocabularies/names.md#using-orcid-public-data-sync).

### Search improvements

Both user and record search have been enhanced to return more accurate results for common names/titles, partial matches (even with typos) and names/titles with accents or diacritics.

Creators, affiliations and funders autocomplete search has been enhanced so that suggestions appear faster and better match what you type.

See [breaking changes](#breaking-changes) for notes about the mapping changes and the new indices.

### Names Vocabulary

TODO
Names listing endpoint is now restricted to authenticated users, names can be "unlisted" not showing anymore in the search result for non-admin users

### Optional DOI

DOIs can now be configured as optional. Describe the feature.

### Administration panel

You'll find several new improvements in the administration panel:

- The default number of results of has been increased from 10 to 20 on all panels
- Records and draft panel:
    - More of the title is shown by default
    - Improved display of files and stats information
    - Fixed narrow viewport display, such as on mobile
    - Owner now links to the ID in the user panel
- User panel:
    - ORCID and GitHub icons now link to the user's profile

#### Compare revisions

The new `Compare Revisions` feature allows administrators to audit record updates and follow changes over time.

From the **Records** list, click the **“Compare revisions…”** button in the _Actions_ column to open a side-by-side comparison window:

![Records List: Compare Revisions](./imgs/records.png)

A modal window appears, allowing you to choose two revisions to compare:

![Compare Modal: Version Selection](./imgs/records-compare-select.png)

The changes are then displayed in a JSON **side-by-side diff** view:

![Compare Modal: Diff View](./imgs/records-compare.png)

!!! info "Revisions VS versions"

    This feature allows admins to compare revisions, not versions. A revision is the result of editing a record, where each published edit creates a new revision. A new version is a different record which is semantically linked to the previous record. At this time it is not possible to compare different records, including versions.

### New Metadata Fields

There is a new field called copyright for copyright information, [specification
available here](../../reference/metadata.md). This field will require
reindexing upon the version upgrade.

There are new thesis metadata fields including department, type,
date_submitted, date_defended. thesis:university had been moved to
university inside of the thesis:thesis section, alongside the other new fields.

There is a new edition field under imprint.

### Requests sharing

When a record is shared, its inclusion requests will be also accessible. There is a new filter in the My Dashboard to show the records shared with me.

### Audit logs

InvenioRDM now comes with a new audit logs feature. See the [related documentation here](../../operate/customize/audit-logs.md).

![Administration Panel](../../operate/customize/imgs/audit-logs.png)

### Communities

#### Themed communities

Communities can now have their own theming with a custom font and colors, which apply to all community pages including records and requests. Below is an example of one "default" and two themed communities on Zenodo.

![A default community and two themed communities on Zenodo](imgs/themed-communities.png)

Themed communities benefit from a custom homepage, defined via HTML template in `<instance>/templates/themes/<theme>/invenio_communities/details/home/index.html`.

#### Subcommunities

It is now possible to create hierarchical relationships between communities, allowing for departments, subject areas and other structures to be represented via related communities. Records from the "child" community are automatically indexed in the "parent" community, allowing all the records of the children to be browsed in the parents. The communities are also bidirectionally linked so that it is easy to navigate between both.

Having subcommunities also enables the **Browse** page, which lists all the subcommunities and [collections](#collections) of that community.

!!! note

    Currently communities can only have one level of hierarchy (i.e., no grand-child communities) and communities can only have one parent community.

#### Collections

Collections are a "big" feature added to v13.

!!! warning

    Collections require new database tables, therefore its migration recipes must be executed (`invenio db upgrade` or similar).

A collection serves as a curated set of records that are grouped based on a specific filter or query, displayed on a dedicated page, introducing a new way of organizing records within a community. For instance, a collection can be defined within a community to highlight records sharing common attributes, like funding programs or specific categories.

Collections are stored in the Database and each collection defines a search query string that is used to fetch each collection records. Find more information in the [RFC](https://github.com/inveniosoftware/rfcs/blob/master/rfcs/rdm-0079-collections.md).

**How to create a collection for a community**

Currently collections are created using a python shell (`invenio shell`)

Requirements:

- A community.
- A collection tree that acts as the "root" node of the collection.

If you do not have a collection tree, start by creating one:

```python
from invenio_collections.api import CollectionTree

ctree = CollectionTree.create(
    title="Programs", order=10, community_id="<community_uuid>", slug="programs"
)
```

The `order` parameter controls the order that trees are rendered in the UI.

Create a collection under `programs`:

```python
from invenio_collections.proxies import current_collections
from invenio_access.permissions import system_identity

collections_service = current_collections.service

# Use another identity if needed
identity = system_identity

# Desired community ID
community_id = "9d0d45ce-0ea9-424a-ab17-a72215b2e8c3"

collection = collections_service.create(
        identity,
        community_id,
        tree_slug="programs",
        slug="h2020",
        title="Horizon 2020",
        query="metadata.funding.program:h2020",
        order=10
    )
```

For nested collections, the `add` service method can be used:

```python

h2020 = collections_service.read(
    identity, community_id=community_id, tree_slug='programs', slug='h2020'
)

open_records = collections_service.add(
        identity,
        collection=h2020._collection,
        slug="h-open-records",
        title="Horizon 2020 (Open records)",
        query="access.record:public",
        order=20
    )
```

All the service methods that create collections also implements the Unit of Work pattern, so it can used if transactional consistency is needed.

The created collections can be accessed at:

- https://127.0.0.1:5000/communities/<community_slug>/collections/h2020
- https://127.0.0.1:5000/communities/<community_slug>/collections/h-open-records

Adjust the URL and `community_slug` as needed.

An overview of all the collections can be found in the community browse page (if enabled):

- https://127.0.0.1:5000/communities/<community_slug>/browse

### Helm charts

To be announced?

### FAIR signposting level 1

In order to increase discoverability, [FAIR signposting level 1](https://signposting.org/FAIR/#level1) can be enabled with the configuration flag `APP_RDM_RECORD_LANDING_PAGE_FAIR_SIGNPOSTING_LEVEL_1_ENABLED = True`. Once enabled, FAIR signposting information will be directly included in the `Link` HTTP response header.

[FAIR signposting level 2](https://signposting.org/FAIR/#level2) was already enabled by default since v12. The response header of each record's landing page includes a `Link` header pointing to a JSON-based linkset which contains the FAIR signposting information.

Please note that for records having many authors, files, or licenses, FAIR signposting will fall back to level 2 only, in order to avoid generating excessively big HTTP response headers.

However, since enabling FAIR signposting level 1 does increase the size of HTTP response headers, it is recommended to edit the `nginx` configuration and specify [`uwsgi_buffer_size`](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_uwsgi_module.html#uwsgi_buffer_size) with a higher limit than the default values. If you have enabled `uwsgi_buffering on;`, then [`uwsgi_buffers`](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_uwsgi_module.html#uwsgi_buffers) may also be adjusted.

```nginx
server {
   # ...
   # Allow for larger HTTP response headers for FAIR signposting level 1 support
   uwsgi_buffer_size 16k;
   # optional if uwsgi_buffering on;
   uwsgi_buffers 8 16k;

   # ...
}
```

### Custom schemes for persistent identifiers

The Invenio [idutils](https://github.com/inveniosoftware/idutils) module handles validation and normalization of persistent identifiers used in scholarly communication, and existing customizations may be affected by changes in v13.
The library has been restructured to use a configurable scheme system with a new entrypoint mechanism for registering custom identifier schemes.

See the [related documentation](../../operate/customize/metadata/custom_pids_schemes.md) how to add your own custom schemes.

### Miscellaneous additions

Here is a quick summary of the myriad other improvements in this release:

- The creators' roles are now displayed [PR](https://github.com/inveniosoftware/invenio-app-rdm/pull/2795)
- You can now see and show the version of InvenioAppRDM and any other module [Issue](https://github.com/inveniosoftware/invenio-app-rdm/issues/2838)
  Change the config ADMINISTRATION_DISPLAY_VERSIONS = [("invenio-app-rdm", f"v{__version__}")] and append to the list the version you want to display.
- The users API endpoint is now protected, in order to access the list of users it's required to be logged in.
- Custom awards: relaxed required fields (see [PR](https://github.com/inveniosoftware/invenio-vocabularies/pull/429))
- The configuration flags that control the visibility of menu items in the administration panel have been removed, and they are now visible by default. You can remove such flags from your configuration file (if existing) or leave them there, they will have no effect. Removed flags:
  - `COMMUNITIES_ADMINISTRATION_DISABLED`
  - `USERS_RESOURCES_ADMINISTRATION_ENABLED`
  - `JOBS_ADMINISTRATION_ENABLED`
- Following the [latest COUNTER spec](https://www.countermetrics.org/code-of-practice/), the [list of robots and machines](https://github.com/inveniosoftware/counter-robots) have been updated to ensure the stats are counted on human usage.
- Logging: The Flask root logger level has been set to `DEBUG`, enabling all log messages to pass through by default. Handlers are now responsible for filtering messages at the desired level, offering more flexibility for development and production environments.
- [Sitemaps](../../operate/customize/sitemaps.md) are now generated for search engines and other crawlers to discover and index important content (records and communities by default, but customizable). Sitemaps are even automatically linked in your `robots.txt` for ease of discoverability by machine agents.
- ...and many more bug fixes!

## Breaking changes

- Direct imports of identifier schemes (e.g., from idutils.isbn import normalize_isbn) are now deprecated and will be removed in future versions. If you have custom code that directly imports scheme modules, you'll need to update it to use the new API.
